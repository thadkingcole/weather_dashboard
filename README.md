## Usage

### Getting Started

First, navigate to <https://thadkingcole.github.io/weather_dashboard>

If this is your first time visiting the page, the weather for Raleigh, NC will be displayed. If Raleigh's weather is not of interest to you, you can [search for a new city](#searching-for-a-new-city).

### Searching for a New City

To find the weather of a new city, simply type in that city into the search bar and hit enter or press the blue search button.

You can help narrow the search by including the 2 letter state abbreviation (if applicable) and/or the 2 letter country abbreviation. This is especially useful to distinguish between two cities in different states that share the same name such as Albany, NY and Albany, GA.

### Search History

With each city you find, it will be added to your search history directly below the search bar on the left side of the page.
